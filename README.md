# Are-Prototypical-Networks-good-few-shot-learners

This github based on Study a recently proposed deep learning method for few-shot learning in a more challenging problem than it was introduced.

### Learning to learn:
In AI applications, agents should be able to acquire many skills and adapt to many environments.
We cannot afford to train each skill in each setting from scratch. Instead, 
we need our agents to learn how to learn new tasks faster by reusing previous experience 

### Few-shot learning:
A learning problem where one needs to generalize from many previously
seen solved tasks, to a new previously unseen task, given only a highly limited number of solved instances from the new task.

### Prototypical Networks:
A classifier must be adapted to accommodate new classes that are not seen in training and given only a few examples of each of these classes.
That it connects exactly to the concept of learning to learn since we do not practice on a lot of data but practice on understanding the data.
